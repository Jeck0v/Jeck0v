## 🧪 Upcoming Lab Work

I'm currently designing a self-hosted homelab to support my personal backend projects and DevOps experiments. 
The main goals:

- Deploy and test backend APIs and microservices without relying on paid cloud providers

- Gain deeper experience with Linux system administration, networking, and security

- Build, automate, and monitor infrastructure using production-grade tools

- Explore the core components of modern cloud architecture (Kubernetes, DNS, reverse proxies, service discovery, etc.)

- Maintain full ownership and observability over my deployments
